# Contemporary Issues In Data

## Article 1
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/government-surveillance-by-data.html

This New York Times article concerns a discovery that the United States Military purchased commercial data (so, not illegally) which depicted the movement of Americans. I think this is less of an issue with the military as it is with these companies that are taking our data, usually without our knowledge.

For example, in the article they mention that someone used an app “to pray,” and their data was later found on a military database. Also, who the hell is finding information on the military database? Can our military not prevent people from accessing their database? Many flaws in many systems here..

## Article 2

This other New York Times article also concerns privacy of American citizens, but this time it is defending the government. The event was during the Black Lives Matter protests, where many peaceful protests were held. At four of these protests, recon planes were sighted flying over the cities, and people were obviously upset. Some people thought the planes were meant to spy on protestors, but apparently they were just there to make sure nothing went awry.

Personally, I think the military should be allowed to do generally whatever they want as long as they’re not bothering anyone, just for the sole purpose of, “maybe they’re doing something really important that the public can’t know about,” maybe this is wishful thinking but I like to think like this. Obviously they did not do a great job (at least the police didn’t) during that time frame, as they did more than bother people.
